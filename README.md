# Analyzing Tree Data
## ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³
This is a lab performed by Owen Cruz-Abrams, Class of 2026 at Aspen High School. The lab aims to determine the effect of elevation on tree height, and uses a large enough dataset that control variables are largely unnecessary.
## Purpose
To determine the effect of elevation on tree height, and thus the effect of elevation on the ability of trees to grow.
The actual research question states:
> How does the elevation of a tree (2500-3100m) affect its average height (meters)?

## Data Collection
We collected data from the following source:
- [Tree Data](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2jm63xsrf)
- [City Elevation Data](https://edits.nationalmap.gov/apps/gaz-domestic/public/search/names)
## Data Exploration
See `notebooks/eda.ipynb` for the code used to explore the data.
## Meaning of Data Columns
See the following table, taken directly from the dataset. We are specifically looking at the tree height in meters to average for each city, etc.

## Analysis
1. We needed a dataset of all the city names. I produced this dataset (see `data/city_elevation.csv`) by using the National Map's API to search for all cities in the tree dataset. See `notebooks/get_city_elevation.ipynb` for the code used to generate this dataset.
2. We then used the `pandas` library to merge the tree dataset with the city dataset. This allowed us to calculate the average tree length for each city. See `scripts/analyze_tree_data.py` for the code used to merge the datasets and calculate the average tree length for each city.
3. We saved this new dataset, with elevation for each tree, to `data/tree_data_with_elevation.csv`.
4. From there, we analyzed the data in a massive spreadsheet, and calculated the average tree height for each elevation. We did not publish this spreadsheet, but we did publish the code used to analyze the data. See `notebooks/analyze_tree_data.ipynb` for the code used to analyze the data.
